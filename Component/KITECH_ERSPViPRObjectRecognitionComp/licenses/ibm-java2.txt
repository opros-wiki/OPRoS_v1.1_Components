   International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

   Part 1 - General Terms

   PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM. IBM WILL
   LICENSE THE PROGRAM TO YOU ONLY IF YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS
   AGREEMENT. BY USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT
   AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED PROGRAM
   TO THE PARTY (EITHER IBM OR ITS RESELLER) FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO
   RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID.

   The Program is owned by International Business Machines Corporation or one
   of its subsidiaries (IBM) or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and
   licensed, not sold.

   The term "Program" means the original program and all whole or partial
   copies of it. A Program consists of machine- readable instructions, its
   components, data, audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings,
   or pictures), and related licensed materials.

   This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms and Part 2 - Country-unique
   Terms and is the complete agreement regarding the use of this Program, and
   replaces any prior oral or written communications between you and IBM. The
   terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1.

   1. License

   Use of the Program

   IBM grants you a nonexclusive license to use the Program.

   You may 1) use the Program to the extent of authorizations you have
   acquired and 2) make and install copies to support the level of use
   authorized, providing you reproduce the copyright notice and any other
   legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.

   If you acquire this Program as a program upgrade, your authorization to
   use the Program from which you upgraded is terminated.

   You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program does so only in
   compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

   You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as
   provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or
   otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law
   without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or
   lease the Program.

   Transfer of Rights and Obligations

   You may transfer all your license rights and obligations under a Proof of
   Entitlement for the Program to another party by transferring the Proof of
   Entitlement and a copy of this Agreement and all documentation. The
   transfer of your license rights and obligations terminates your
   authorization to use the Program under the Proof of Entitlement.

   2. Proof of Entitlement

   The Proof of Entitlement for this Program is evidence of your
   authorization to use this Program and of your eligibility for future
   upgrade program prices (if announced) and potential special or promotional
   opportunities.

   3. Charges and Taxes

   IBM defines use for the Program for charging purposes and specifies it in
   the Proof of Entitlement. Charges are based on extent of use authorized.
   If you wish to increase the extent of use, notify IBM or its reseller and
   pay any applicable charges. IBM does not give refunds or credits for
   charges already due or paid.

   If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based
   on IBM's net income, upon the Program supplied by IBM under this
   Agreement, then you agree to pay that amount as IBM specifies or supply
   exemption documentation.

   4. No Warranty

   SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES
   NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON- INFRINGEMENT AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE
   PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY. IBM MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE
   CAPABILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO CORRECTLY PROCESS, PROVIDE AND/OR RECEIVE
   DATE DATA WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE 20TH AND 21ST CENTURIES.

   The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's subcontractors, suppliers, or
   program developers (collectively called "Suppliers").

   Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide
   their own warranties.

   5. Limitation of Liability

   NEITHER IBM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT
   DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR ANY
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR OTHER ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF IBM
   IS INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE
   ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   6. General

   Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that
   cannot be waived or limited by contract.

   IBM may terminate your license if you fail to comply with the terms of
   this Agreement. If IBM does so, you must immediately destroy the Program
   and all copies you made of it.

   You agree to comply with applicable export laws and regulations.

   Neither you nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
   than two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided
   by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

   Neither you nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations
   due to causes beyond its control.

   IBM does not provide program services or technical support, unless IBM
   specifies otherwise.

   The laws of the country in which you acquire the Program govern this
   Agreement, except 1) in Australia, the laws of the State or Territory in
   which the transaction is performed govern this Agreement; 2) in Albania,
   Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
   Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Former Yugoslav Republic of
   Macedonia (FYROM), Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic,
   Slovenia, Ukraine, and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the laws of Austria
   govern this Agreement; 3) in the United Kingdom, all disputes relating to
   this Agreement will be governed by English Law and will be submitted to
   the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts; 4) in Canada, the laws
   in the Province of Ontario govern this Agreement; and 5) in the United
   States and Puerto Rico, and People's Republic of China, the laws of the
   State of New York govern this Agreement.
